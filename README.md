### üè∑Ô∏è Sentence Tag Definitions

Each sentence is evaluated using the following ESG-related tags:

| Tag            | Definition                                                                 | Identified By                                                                                         |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `target`        | Identifies a specific goal, pledge, or objective.                           | Keywords such as *"target"*, *"aim to"*, *"commit to"*, or quantified aims like *"reduce by 30%"*.     |
| `time_bound`    | Indicates whether a time frame or deadline is mentioned.                    | References like *"by 2030"*, *"annually"*, *"Q1 2024"*, *"before the end of the year"*, etc.           |
| `numeric`       | Detects quantitative metrics or figures.                                    | Percentages, currency, emission units, counts of people or resources.                                 |
| `comparability` | Shows if the sentence allows comparison across time, standards, or baselines. | Phrases like *"compared to last year"*, *"vs. target"*, *"baseline"*, *"GHG protocol"*, *"YoY"*.      |
| `dimension`     | Classifies the sentence into ESG dimensions: Environmental (`E`), Social (`S`), Governance (`G`), or `None`. | Keyword matching against curated ESG vocabulary lists.                                                |

Tags are assigned using a rule-based method (regex + keyword matching), without machine learning or LLMs.
